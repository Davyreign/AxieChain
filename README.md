# axiechain

We built a decentralized app that allows you swap assets between two chains using Axelar and Axelar gateway on BNB chain. You can check Gas Price first before you proceed to swap.
The list of chains you can swap on are the ones available on Axelar. We used AxelarQueryAPI to get all available assets and gas price information. We used the getGasInfo and getActiveChains methods
